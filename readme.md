# The XRPL Meta Node
### Development Version 2


This branch is a complete overhaul of the previous version (stable branch), which comes with countless performance and feature improvements. Ledgers are now being diffed continuously instead of being scanned in a fixed interval.


Detailed documentation and a first release candidate will come early July.
